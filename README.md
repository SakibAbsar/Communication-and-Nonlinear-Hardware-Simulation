# OFDM based RF Communication and Nonlinear Hardware Simulation
This project simulates a MATLAB-based OFDM RF transceiver system for point-to-point transmission, focusing on signal quality and error rate analysis under AWGN and frequency-selective fading channels.

Features
Modulation: 16-QAM, 16-PSK
Channel Coding: [7,4] Hamming code
Nonlinear Hardware Simulation: RF amplifier clipping
BER vs. SNR Analysis: Evaluates signal integrity under varying conditions
Usage
Clone the repository and open main.m in MATLAB.
Configure parameters and run the script to view BER plots and signal visualizations.
